
'Lovehate'-keybord


I created seven scenes each in a 'composite'. A chop 'switch' connected to a 'keybord' allows you to switch from one scene to another in real time. This allows you to manage the animation. The title 'love-hate' refers to the possible human choices of love or hate that each journalist encounter entails.
